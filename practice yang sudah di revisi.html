        <p>“The internal architectural design of computers differs from one system model to another. However, the basic organization remains the same for all computer systems. The following five units (also called “The functional units”) correspond to the five basic operations performed by all computer systems.”</p>

            <h2>Computer</h2>
            
            <p>Computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.</p>

            <h3>1. Input Unit</h3>
            
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQQAboYo_52dC7XTM6RbSdq0Fp_L45iBZG8e4h9qpbDdvEuoraK">
            
            <p>Data and instructions must enter the computer system before any computation can be performed on the supplied data. The input unit that links the external environment with the computer system performs this task. Data and instructions enter input units in forms that depend upon the particular device used. For example, data is entered from a keyboard in a manner similar to typing, and this differs from the way in which data is entered through a mouse, which is another type of input device. However, regardless of the form in which they receive their inputs, all input devices must provide a computer with data that are transformed into the binary codes that the primary memory of the computer is designed to accept. This transformation is accomplished by units that called input interfaces. Input interfaces are designed to match the unique physical or electrical characteristics of input devices to the requirements of the computer system.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Output Unit </h3>
            
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQkp7B7gJZQuaZaWn94qpuqL0szMQE1h41MDQmbWDG5ARwG2ZWZ">
            
            <p>The job of an output unit is just the reverse of that of an input unit. It supplied information and results of computation to the outside world. Thus it links the computer with the external environment. As computers work with binary code, the results produced are also in the binary form. Hence, before supplying the results to the outside world, it must be converted to human acceptable (readable) form. This task is accomplished by units called output interfaces.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Storage Unit</h3>
            
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQrBxBfnYMlofbG1LIgInpOUvoOBuNQx9nhFFupK-Gj8aFzU-fG">
            
            <p>The data and instructions that are entered into the computer system through input units have to be stored inside the computer before the actual processing starts. Similarly, the results produced by the computer after processing must also be kept somewhere inside the computer system before being passed on to the output units. Moreover, the intermediate results produced by the computer must also be preserved for ongoing processing. The Storage Unit or the primary / main storage of a computer system is designed to do all these things. It provides space for storing data and instructions, space for intermediate results and also space for the final results.</p>
            
            <h3>4.Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
            
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSuTkdfCdE9UAWXqrJsWme75PQs2DstTb0e7eJvnEXCqy96foyG">
            
            <p>The main unit inside the computer is the CPU. This unit is responsible for all events inside the computer. It controls all internal and external devices, performs “Arithmetic and Logical operations”. The operations a Microprocessor performs are called “instruction set” of this processor. The instruction set is “hard wired” in the CPU and determines the machine language for the CPU. The more complicated the instruction set is, the slower the CPU works. Processors differed from one another by the instruction set. If the same program can run on two different computer brands they are said to be compatible. Programs written for IBM compatible computers will not run on Apple computers because these two architectures are not compatible.</p>
           
            <h3>5. Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
            
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/be/42/11/be42117b8a6329b127cb604df82d3182.jpg">
            
            <p>The arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) of a computer system is the place where the actual execution of the instructions take place during the processing operations. All calculations are performed and all comparisons (decisions) are made in the ALU. The data and instructions, stored in the primary storage prior to processing are transferred as and when needed to the ALU where processing takes place. No processing is done in the primary storage unit. Intermediate results generated in the ALU are temporarily transferred back to the primary storage until needed at a later time. Data may thus move from primary storage to ALU and back again as storage many times before the processing is over. After the completion of processing, the final results which are stored in the storage unit are released to an output device.</p>
